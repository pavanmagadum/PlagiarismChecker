Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

The evidence for rapid climate change is compelling. Global temperature is rising, ocean warming is occurring, ice sheets are shrinking, glaciers are retreating, snow cover is decreasing, sea level is rising, Arctic sea ice is declining, and extreme weather events are increasing in frequency.

Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.
